# Easygo coding test

## Initial Setup

Run `npm i` to install node modules.

Run `npm run dev` to run the development server.

Use `http://localhost:5173/` in browser to open development server in browser.

Enjoy ;)

## Summary

Hi everyone,

Thank you for the opportunity, I thoroughly enjoyed completing the task, as I was able to showcase my skillset and also overcome areas that were challenging.

### Extra Points

I didn't manage to meet all the extra points but covered a good portion. I tried using svelte-pixi but ran into errors that were too time-consuming to resolve. The documentation for pixi-svelte was limited, so I opted for a better-documented option as I hadn't used PixiJS before. With more time, I would have added Storybook.

### Challenges

As it was my first time using PixiJS, I had to grasp some basics:

State: Understanding how state works in PixiJS was different from my experience with DOM manipulation.

Dimensions: I initially aimed to make the app responsive but decided against it as it was time-consuming and not a bonus feature.

Texture Positions: Aligning Pokémon names with textures was the biggest challenge. Once I figured out how the slot machine mechanics worked, I used a nested array system to track Pokémon positions and determine wins.

### Choices

Pokémon: I used Pokémon due to its accessibility and visual appeal. The Pokémon API allowed me to reduce image storage, lowering the app's strain.

Nested Arrays: I used a nested array system to track the positions of textures. This approach allowed me to quickly identify which texture was in each slot and determine the win conditions.

I look forward to your feedback and next step.
